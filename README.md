  Clone this repository into your home directory like so:

      git clone https://github.com/mgw51/emacs-directory .emacs.d

  'init.el' is located in .emacs.d directory.  '.emacs' files take
  precedence over 'init.el' files at startup.  Be sure your home
  directory contains no '.emacs' file by either renaming or deleting
  it if one exists.
