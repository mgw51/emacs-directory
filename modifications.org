* Config Modification Ideas
** TODO lsp-find-references
Calling this function brings up the minibuffer using ~consult~ (maybe?) which does not
make a whole lot of sense in this context.  I don't want to start typing to match
something.  I want to be able to easily jump to entries in the list.  What settings do
I need to change to make that happen?
